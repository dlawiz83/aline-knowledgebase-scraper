## üìñ Project Overview

This project is a **robust, reusable scraper** that extracts technical knowledge from various sources, including:

- PDF book chapters (Aline‚Äôs book, chapters 1 to 8)
- Interviewing.io blog posts and guides
- Nil Mamano‚Äôs DS&A blog posts
- Generic blogs (configurable selectors)

It compiles all scraped content into a **standardized JSON knowledgebase** format for use in AI-driven comment generation tools.

## üß† Thinking Process & Design Decisions

I built this scraper with **scalability and reusability** as core principles:

- **Base Scraper Class:** To keep code DRY and modular, each source scraper inherits common logic.
- **Dynamic PDF Chapter Extraction:** Uses regex to detect chapters dynamically rather than relying on fixed pages.
- **Tailored Blog Scrapers:** Specific scrapers for each blog‚Äôs unique structure, plus a configurable generic scraper.
- **Markdown Conversion:** Converts HTML content to Markdown for readability and consistency.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** To ensure maintainability and quick debugging when sources change.
- **Configurable & Extensible:** Easy to add new sources by extending the base scraper or configuring selectors.

This approach ensures the tool can scale to future customers and various content types without heavy customization.
